This package contains a least trimmed squares algorithm modified for geophysical array processing and written in Python3. These codes are referenced in *Bishop, J.W., Fee, D., & Szuberla, C. A. L., (2020). Improved infrasound array processing with robust estimators, Geophysical Journal International*.

See the `README.md` for installation instructions.

A broader set of geophysical array processing codes are available `here  <https://github.com/uafgeotools/array_processing>`_, which utilizes this package as the default (and preferred) array processing algorithm.
